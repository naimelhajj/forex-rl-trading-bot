FOREX RL TRADING BOT - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
A complete DQN-based reinforcement learning system for Forex trading with
comprehensive risk management, advanced feature engineering, and stability-
adjusted fitness metrics.

KEY FEATURES
------------
✓ Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with experience replay
✓ Advanced feature engineering (20+ features)
✓ Multi-currency strength analysis
✓ Sophisticated risk management and position sizing
✓ Stability-adjusted fitness metric
✓ Weekend/holiday position protection
✓ Automatic SL/TP on every trade
✓ Single position constraint
✓ Gym-compatible environment
✓ Comprehensive evaluation metrics

CORE MODULES
------------
1. agent.py              - DQN agent with target network
2. environment.py        - Trading environment (Gym-compatible)
3. features.py           - Feature engineering (ATR, RSI, fractals, etc.)
4. risk_manager.py       - Position sizing and risk management
5. fitness.py            - Stability-adjusted fitness calculation
6. data_loader.py        - Data loading and preprocessing
7. trainer.py            - Training loop management
8. config.py             - Centralized configuration
9. main.py               - Main entry point

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
- README.md              - Complete documentation
- QUICKSTART.md          - Quick start guide
- ARCHITECTURE.md        - System architecture
- EXAMPLES.md            - Usage examples and code samples
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt    - This file

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Python 3.11+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- Matplotlib

QUICK START
-----------
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run system test:
   python test_system.py

3. Train the agent:
   python main.py --mode train --episodes 50

4. Evaluate:
   python main.py --mode evaluate --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pt

ACTION SPACE
------------
0: HOLD              - Maintain current position
1: LONG              - Open/maintain long position
2: SHORT             - Open/maintain short position
3: MOVE_SL_CLOSER    - Tighten stop loss

RISK MANAGEMENT
---------------
- Risk-based position sizing (default 2% per trade)
- Margin constraint enforcement
- Drawdown survivability checks
- Automatic SL/TP calculation
- Broker constraint compliance

FITNESS METRIC
--------------
Fitness = w₁×Sharpe + w₂×CAGR - w₃×Stagnation - w₄×LossYears - [5 if ruined]

Default weights:
- Sharpe ratio: 1.0
- CAGR: 2.0
- Stagnation: 1.0
- Loss years: 1.0
- Ruin penalty: 5.0

CONFIGURATION
-------------
All parameters are configurable in config.py:
- Feature engineering parameters
- Risk management settings
- Agent hyperparameters
- Training configuration
- Fitness metric weights

TESTING
-------
All core modules have been tested:
✓ Feature engineering
✓ DQN agent
✓ Risk manager
✓ Trading environment
✓ Fitness calculator
✓ Full system integration

EXTENSIBILITY
-------------
The system is designed to be easily extended:
- Add new features in features.py
- Modify reward function in environment.py
- Add new actions in agent.py
- Customize fitness metric in fitness.py
- Adjust risk parameters in config.py

DISCLAIMER
----------
⚠️  This is an EDUCATIONAL project for learning RL and algorithmic trading.
⚠️  NOT tested with real money
⚠️  Past performance does NOT guarantee future results
⚠️  Trading Forex involves substantial risk of loss
⚠️  Always use proper risk management
⚠️  Consult financial professionals before live trading

PROJECT STATUS
--------------
✓ All core modules implemented
✓ All components tested
✓ Documentation complete
✓ System ready for training and experimentation

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Train on your own historical data
2. Experiment with different configurations
3. Optimize hyperparameters
4. Backtest on multiple time periods
5. Paper trade before considering live deployment
